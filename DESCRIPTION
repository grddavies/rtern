Title: A C-like Conditional Ternary Operator for R
Version: 0.0.1
Authors@R: 
    person(given = "Gethin",
           family = "Davies",
           role = c("aut", "cre"),
           email = "grd.davies@gmail.com")
Description: It brings a C-like ternary conditional operator using `?` and `:` to R.
    This groundbreaking spoonful of syntactic sugar will supercharge your workflow and see you bubble to the top of Kaggle leaderboards.
    The only downside is that it masks the base functionality of `?`. Who needs help files? Not you, champ.
